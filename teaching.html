It introduces the kinds of questions traditionally addressed by physiological and comparative psychologists. Biopsychology is the study of how psychological processes relate to the brain and to evolution. A major focus is on how brain processes cause psychological events and behavior, and how psychological events are encoded in the brain (physiological psychology or behavioral neuroscience). Another focus is on how psychological processes (e.g., perception, cognition) differ across different species, and on how psychological processes have been shaped by evolutionary pressures (comparative or evolutionary psychology).</p> <p>Topics will include: principles of behavioral evolution that have shaped current behavior and physiological processes; the anatomy and operation of brain systems relevant to mind and behavior, and their relation to psychoactive drugs; neural mechanisms of normal action, perception, motivation, learning, and cognition in humans and other species.</p></div></div><!--

Prerequisites include PSYCH 230 (Introduction to Biopsychology) and an interest in biological approaches to the study of behavior. Introductory Chemistry is also recommended. The acute and long-term effects of selected drugs of abuse on behavior, mood, cognition, and neuronal function are discussed, and material from studies with humans is integrated with basic studies on the neurobiological basis of drug action and drug abuse — including synaptic transmission and the distribution, regulation, and integration of brain neurotransmitter systems. The focus is on addictive or illicit drugs, and all the major classes are discussed, including: opiates (heroin, morphine, opium), sedative-hypnotics (alcohol, barbituates, chloral hydrate), anxiolytics (benzodiazepines), psychomotor stimulants (amphetamine, cocaine), marijuana, hallucinogens (LSD, mescaline), hallucinogenic-stimulants (MDA, MDMA), and dissociative anaesthetics (PCP).</p></div></div><!--

We will discuss the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as well as the long-term effects of early life stressors. In addition, we will learn about HPA-axis regulation as well as dysregulation associated with psychopathology including addiction, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The primary “text book” to be used for this course is <span class="italic">“Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers”</span>, by Robert Sapolsky. </p></div></div><!--

However, Pavlovian learning mechanisms can also contribute to maladaptive behaviors and psychopathology, such as impulse control disorders and addiction. In this course, we will examine these topics and discuss the psychological and neurobiological processes underlying Pavlovian learning. The course will begin with a historical perspective of Pavlov’s work and culminate with an understanding of the latest neuroscience articles that have begun to delineate the neurobiological processes that guide motivated behaviors.</p></div></div><!--

It is intended for first and second year graduate students in the biomedical sciences. We use an interdisciplinary approach to introduce relevant topics and animal models used in the field. Topics include addiction, learning and memory, fear conditioning, gut-brain axis (microbiome), cognition and sex differences; and  each of these are discussed with respect to psychiatric illness. By the end of the course, students are expected to:<br>1) appreciate the importance of good experimental design, 2) have an excellent comprehension of the models, tools and techniques used in behavioral neuroscience,<br>3) be able to critically evaluate manuscripts in the field, and 4) have a good understanding of the neural circuits and mechanisms that contribute to both motivated and maladaptive behaviors.</p></div></div><!--

The Flagel Lab has organized an “addiction booth” at this event which consisted of an “operant box” where students learned how powerful cues can be in controlling behavior, a “synaptic foosball table” where students learned how cocaine acts on the dopamine system, and a “walk the line” activity where students were challenged with “beer goggles”. In addition, we devised a “stress booth” to illustrate both the beneficial and deleterious effects of the stress response on the brain and body. </p></div></div><!--

It is a challenge to adapt to teaching all of these different age groups, but also a lot of fun!
