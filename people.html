Flagel was born and raised in Middletown, Ohio, came to Ann Arbor to attend the University of Michigan as an undergraduate, and never left. Dr. Flagel became involved in research through the <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/urop/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program</a> conducted an undergraduate thesis project under the mentorship of <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/directory/profiles/faculty/?uniquename=liberzon" target="_blank">Dr. Israel Liberzon</a>, and graduated with High Honors in Psychology as a Natural Science. She then matriculated into the <a href="http://neuroscience.med.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Neuroscience Graduate Program</a> and conducted her graduate thesis work under the mentorship of <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~vazquezd/" target="_blank">Drs. Delia Vazquez</a> and <a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/terryrobinson/home" target="_blank">Terry Robinson</a>. Her thesis project examined the effects of early life stress on drug-taking behavior in adulthood. After obtaining her PhD, Dr. Flagel joined the laboratory of <a href="http://www.mbni.med.umich.edu/mbni/faculty/akil/akil.html" target="_blank">Dr. Huda Akil</a> and conducted her postdoctoral training at the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute at the University of Michigan. Dr. Flagel "opened" her lab in the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute at the University of Michigan in 2011 and is now an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry. In addition to "doing science", Dr. Flagel enjoys being the mom of two young boys, the outdoors, exercising and travelling.</p></div></div><!--

During his studies he worked in the laboratory of 'Developmental Psychobiology and Behavioral Genetics' under the mentorship of Prof. Simona Cabib, where he studied how the impact of a previous stress history alters the behavioral and neural adaptations to environmental challenges in different inbred mouse strains. In December 2014 Paolo received his Ph.D. in Behavioral Neuroscience from Sapienza University, with a dissertation titled "A genotype-environment interaction modulates the involvement of different memory systems in the consolidation of stress related memories." In September 2015 Paolo came to Ann Arbor to join the Flagel Lab as a post-doctoral fellow. His current research interests are focused on the study of the brain mechanisms underlying maladaptive behaviors and the study of individual differences in liability to drug addiction. In his spare time, Paolo loves playing guitar, listening to rock music and home-recording.</p></div></div><!--

His thesis examined the contribution of methamphetamine-induced dysfunctions in the corticostriatal pathway to persistent drug seeking behavior. He is now a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Huda Akil’s laboratory, and collaborates with the Flagel Lab on a regular basis. Aram’s overall research interest is to understand how environment, behavioral experiences, and neurobiological factors contribute to susceptibility for neuropsychiatric conditions including mood disorders and drug addiction.</p></div></div><!--

He then obtained his Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins University in Dr. Peter Holland's laboratory, completing a thesis on the neural basis of sign-tracking. Steve next completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Dartmouth College in Dr. Kyle Smith's laboratory investigating the neural circuitry of cue-reward learning. Steve joined the Flagel lab in September 2018. His current research interests are focused on understanding the neural pathways mediating reward-seeking behaviors that may result in the development of drug addiction.</p></div></div><!--

She then went on to complete her veterinary medicine degree at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. During that time, she was able to explore the laboratory animal field as a summer fellow at MIT and an extern at various academic research institutions – gaining a global perspective of veterinary medicine. In the summer of 2017, she joined the University of Michigan as a veterinary resident in laboratory animal medicine. Her research involvement includes qualification of DNA mutations in guinea pigs, development of a guide to assess pain in mice, and evaluating the enrichment preferences of zebrafish. Lauren was awarded Associate Fellow status by the Higher Education Academy in the UK in recognition of her contribution to teaching and supporting learning in higher education. In her spare time, Lauren enjoys hiking with her dog and travelling.</p></div></div><!--

While at CSUF, she participated in the Maximizing Access to Research Careers program under the mentorship of Dr. Jennifer Trevitt; where she studied the effects of a western diet and physical activity on anxiety and learning. Amanda joined the Program in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Michigan and matriculated into the Neuroscience Graduate Program in the fall of 2017. Her research interests include the complex biological mechanisms and subcortical, hypothalamic neural circuitry that may subserve individual differences in cue-motivated behaviors. And, more specifically, how these differences can help us understand maladaptive behaviors related to reward and motivation, such as drug addiction. Amanda enjoys spending time with her dog, hiking, and crafting in her spare time.</p></div></div><!--
